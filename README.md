**3. Insights, thoughts & conclusion**

- In 1, the Language tool is able to correctly assess a negative review of the videogame "Palworld"
- In 2 the tool is able to provide us with information about Teachers, the United States and the American Constitution
- In 3, an opinion-based text is analyzed for opinion, it expresses the importance of reflection, interestingly it is labeled as negative, possibly due to the subject matter.
- Lastly in 4, we summarize the song "Roda Viva" from Chico Buarque, and the text does its best, though it is a highly poetic language unsuited for this tool.
